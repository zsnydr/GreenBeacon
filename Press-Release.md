## Project Name #
  Green Beacon

## Heading ##
  The best way to get help from other Makersquare students.

## Sub-Heading ##
Whether you are looking for help or willing to give help, do so in the most efficient way by using Green Beacon.

## Summary ##
If any Makersquare student needs help, they create a request with their concern using the app. Another student who is willing to give help
can look through all the requests and choose one to respond to. Students can easily find current location of the person who created the ticket
by hovering on the message. Once claimed, the student who asked for help will receive the alert message with the name of the person
who is on their way to help. After help received, the ticket's creator can either mark their ticket as solved and remove it from the queue, or mark it as not solved and wait for another person to come to the rescue.

## Problem ##
Students have to wait for a while for their helpdesk requests to be resolved. Sometimes fellows get very busy and might not be able to help everybody on time.

## Solution ##
Students no longer have to wait for fellows to respond to their help requests. They can easily get help from other students.
This not only gives them possibility to share their knowledge and practice their communication skills, but also get to know their peers better.
